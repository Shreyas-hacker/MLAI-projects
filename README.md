# MLAI-projects

This is a repository which contains all the projects I have done for each specific portion of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

1) Digit Recognitioon
 -> Instead of doing normal digit recognition using MNIST dataset, I used canny edge detection on the datatset and fed the canny images to the neural network so that
 it could predict any kind handwritten images
 
 2) NLP: Chatbot(Still in progress)
